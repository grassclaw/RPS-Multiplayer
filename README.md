# RPS-V2
Version 2 of Rock paper scissors


Much of the styling was taking from existing templates as opposed to writing it from scratch. I attempted a different styling from an online template but the classes got very complicated. The css styling was all predone and I just made minor modifications.

The logic already existed from a previous activity we did in class but had to be modified to go into firebase. I dont actually know how you can see my firebase but I only keep track of what the players did and their names etc. Everything resets when someone refreshes which is cool except if you're in the waiting queue and the other person hits refresh then it resets you in the queue without telling you and you'll just be stuck their forever. You must both refresh at the same time pretty much and then type your names in together.
